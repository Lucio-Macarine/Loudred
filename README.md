# Loudred Bot - A Discord sound player
![alt Demonstration image 1](https://i.imgur.com/jxdZRyk.png)

Loudred is a small project by LÃºcio Macarine to bring music streaming back to discord. We (as in me lol) believes that using external resources to basically "pipe" music to discord shouldn't be limited because of youtube DMCAS.

As you all know, or at least should, youtube has been murdering the "music in discord" community because you don't have to watch ads to listen to "illegal pirated 100% unsafe dangerous virus 2023 beware" discord music streamed from bots.

So how do we stop that?

\- **We can't.** Unless you are some sort of lunatic that wants to go to court with youtube or something knowing full well you are going to loose. (i guess)

**But there are other options...**

You can self host your own music bot that streams music just for you and your friends (that i wish i had). This is exactly that. An application that **can play music on discord**

But the catch is that it's not a huge 13M+ users bot that streams the music for you. It's the application itself.

That means that **YOU** (As in whoever is running the application) are streaming the music. 

(Not only that but you can also stream from almost any website on the planet, including cloud hosted mp3 files)

## Now the technobabble
This bot uses yt-dlp and ffmpeg to stream the music to the discord API. Which means you have to have them installed for this to work (at least for now).
